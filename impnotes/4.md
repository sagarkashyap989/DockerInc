Alright 😄 let’s go step-by-step with **Practical No. 4**.
This one is **important for marks** because it includes **vulnerability scanning**, which examiners love.

## 🧪 Practical No. 4

### **Vulnerability Scanning and Assessment**

---

## ✅ Aim

To perform **vulnerability scanning and assessment** using **Nmap** and **Nikto** in Kali Linux.



---

## 🛠 Tools Used

* **Nmap** – for network & service vulnerability scanning
* **Nikto** – for web server vulnerability scanning
* OS: **Kali Linux**

---

## STEP 1️⃣: Start Kali Linux

1. Open **VirtualBox**
2. Start **Kali Linux**
3. Login normally

---

## STEP 2️⃣: Vulnerability Scanning using Nmap

### Open Terminal and run:

```bash
nmap -sV scanme.nmap.org
```

### Explanation:

* `-sV` → Detects **service versions**
* Helps identify **vulnerable services**

---

### (Optional – for better answer)

```bash
nmap --script vuln scanme.nmap.org
```

👉 Runs **Nmap vulnerability scripts**

---

## STEP 3️⃣: Vulnerability Scanning using Nikto

### Open Nikto via Terminal:

```bash
nikto -h scanme.nmap.org
```

### What Nikto Does:

* Scans **web servers**
* Detects:

  * Outdated software
  * Insecure headers
  * Misconfigurations
  * Known vulnerabilities

---

## STEP 4️⃣: Nikto with SSL Website

```bash
nikto -h https://nmap.org -ssl
```

### Explanation:

* `-ssl` → Scans HTTPS websites

---

## STEP 5️⃣: Scan Multiple Domains (As per Practical File)

### Create domain list:

```bash
cat > domain.txt
scanme.nmap.org
nmap.org
```

(Press **CTRL + D** to save)

### Scan list:

```bash
nikto -h domain.txt
```

---

## STEP 6️⃣: Save Scan Output to File

```bash
nikto -h nmap.org -o scan.txt
```

👉 Output saved in `scan.txt`

---

## 📌 Observation

* Open ports & services detected (Nmap)
* Web vulnerabilities identified (Nikto)
* Server configuration details displayed

---

## ✍️ Write This in Your Practical File (VERY IMPORTANT)

### **Aim:**

To identify vulnerabilities using Nmap and Nikto.

### **Tools Used:**

* Nmap
* Nikto

### **Procedure:**

1. Started Kali Linux virtual machine.
2. Performed service version detection using Nmap.
3. Used Nikto to scan web server vulnerabilities.
4. Scanned HTTP and HTTPS targets.
5. Saved vulnerability scan output to file.

### **Result:**

Vulnerabilities in the target system were successfully identified using Nmap and Nikto.

## 🔥 Viva-Ready Short Q&A

**Q. What is vulnerability scanning?**
👉 Process of identifying security weaknesses in systems.

**Q. What is Nikto used for?**
👉 Web server vulnerability scanning.

**Q. Difference between Nmap & Nikto?**
👉 Nmap scans networks/services, Nikto scans web servers.
