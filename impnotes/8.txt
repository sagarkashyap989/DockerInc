Nice 👍 **Practical No. 8** is **short, easy, and very theory-friendly**.
We’ll do it **step-by-step**, exactly how it appears in your practical manual.

## 🧪 Practical No. 8

### **Injecting Code in Data-Driven Applications (SQL Injection)**

---

## ✅ Aim

To demonstrate **SQL Injection** in a **web-based application**.



---

## 🛠 Tools / Requirements

* **Web Browser (Chrome / Firefox)**
* **Vulnerable demo website**
* OS: **Windows or Kali Linux**

---

## 🔍 What is SQL Injection? (1-line for exam)

SQL Injection is a technique where **malicious SQL code** is inserted into input fields to **bypass authentication** or manipulate the database.

---

## STEP 1️⃣: Open Browser

Open **Chrome / Firefox** and go to:

```
http://testfire.net
```

---

## STEP 2️⃣: Go to Login Page

1. Click **Online Banking Login**
2. You’ll see **Username** and **Password** fields

---

## STEP 3️⃣: Normal Login Attempt (Fails)

Enter:

* **Username:** test
* **Password:** test

Click **Login**

👉 Output: **Access Denied**

(This shows normal authentication is working)

---

## STEP 4️⃣: Perform SQL Injection

Now enter:

### Username:

```sql
' OR 1=1 --
```

### Password:

```text
anything
```

Click **Login**

---

## 🎯 What Happened?

* `' OR 1=1 --` makes the SQL condition **always TRUE**
* `--` comments out the rest of the query
* Authentication is **bypassed**

✅ You get **access to the portal**

---

## 📌 Observation

* Login bypassed without valid credentials
* Application vulnerable to SQL Injection
* Database query logic manipulated

---

## ✍️ Write This in Practical File (EXAM-READY)

### **Aim:**

To demonstrate SQL Injection in a data-driven web application.

### **Procedure:**

1. Opened a web browser.
2. Accessed vulnerable website login page.
3. Entered invalid credentials and observed access denied.
4. Injected SQL code into username field.
5. Successfully bypassed authentication.

### **Result:**

SQL Injection attack was successfully performed on a vulnerable web application.

## 🔥 Viva-Ready Short Q&A

**Q. What is SQL Injection?**
👉 Inserting malicious SQL queries to manipulate database operations.

**Q. Why does `' OR 1=1 --` work?**
👉 Because `1=1` is always true and `--` comments remaining query.

**Q. Which layer is affected in SQL Injection?**
👉 Database layer.

**Q. How can SQL Injection be prevented?**
👉 Prepared statements, input validation, parameterized queries.
